Jiaming Hu, Kunhan Wu
The relationship between emotion and the stock market has been studied for a long time and it has become a consensus that emotion is an important factor influencing the market. The idea of this project is to use the Internet to extract investorsâ€™ reviews and predict the sentiment of the market. Then, find the relationship between the market sentiment and market trend, evaluating different models based on the metrics we use.
